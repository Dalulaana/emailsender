# Email Sender

It is a simple email sender application built using Node.js and Nodemailer.

I used npm install nodemailer to add library.

So in set up you can choose to whom to send the letter, the subject of the letter and its contents.

## To add a Gmail account to another email client, we have this instruction:

- **Open the Google Account page.**
- **Click Security.**
- **In the "Sign in to your Google account" section, select Two-step authentication.**
- **At the bottom of the page, click Application Passwords.**
- **Specify a name that will help you remember where the application password will be used.**
- **Select Create.**
- **Enter the application password by following the on-screen instructions. The application password is a 16-digit code that is generated on your device.**
- **Click Done.**
